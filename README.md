# RSS Reader

## Developer Extension Notes
My solution is limited by the task. Extension which I would have added 
1. `rss.Parse` function should return error or implement alert mechanism using Sentry (Alerting/Monitoring) for all failed feed retrievals.
2. I would prefer adding golint as pre-hook (server hook) or in the CI system
